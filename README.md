Static Comp
---
In this project we were required to create a responsive web page following the exact layout of this image.

We were allowed freedom to change the content included but not to change the layout itself.

The project was intended for us to practice and strengthen our HTML and CSS .

After completing the project I have a better understanding of the following concepts:

* CSS Grid
* CSS FlexBox
* The Box Model
* Html Tags
* Media Queries
* Normalize.CSS
* Design
